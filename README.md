# TensorFlow #

This folder contains a few tutorials for beginners of TensorFlow. The goal of this series of tutorial is to introduce the reader to the basic concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and, more specifically, to the Deep Learning (DL) algorithm using engaging examples and posing challenging questions. The final idea is to make a series of youtube videos. 

## First Tutorial: Computer_Vision.ipynb ## 

In this first tutorial, we move to the first steps with TensorFlow. The goal is not to explain exactly all the algorithms behind the Neural Network (NN) optimization but rather give a first feeling on the concepts behind ML. We create a simple, single-layer NN to recognize different objects from a set of images extracted from the omnipresent MNIST library.
