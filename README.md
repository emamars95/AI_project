# TensorFlow
I have build this repository as collection of Tesorflow tutorials (mainly with jupyter). 

## First Tutorial
In the first tutorial I explore the Image recognition using a simple 1 hidden layer Neural Network to classify clothing in 10 different categories. Each item of clothing is in a 28x28 greyscale image and are part of the fashion-mnist packages: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.

I explore very simple concepts such as dimension of the input layer, output layer, and some key parameters during the neural network training procedures. 
The key objective is to introduce the not-experted reader to move the first steps in the ML and TensorFlow world.
